A paradigm for robot motion planning based on parameterizations of the free space

## Description
We develop a motion planning algorithm based on the closed-form Minkowski sum and difference between ellipsoids. Full algorithm is developed in Matlab and is now transfering to C++ for fair and convenient comparisons with other algorithms. The algorithm is in 2D single rigid boday case, and is currently being expanded to 3D single body case.
